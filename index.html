		Today is gonna be the day<br>
		That they're gonna throw it back to you<br>
		By now you should've somehow<br>
		Realized what you gotta do<br>
		I don't believe that anybody<br>
		Feels the way I do about you now<br>
		<br>
		Backbeat, the word was on the street<br>
		That the fire in your heart is out<br>
		I'm sure you've heard it all before<br>
		But you never really had a doubt<br>
		I don't believe that anybody<br>
		Feels the way I do about you now<br>
		<br>
		And all the roads we have to walk are winding<br>
		And all the lights that lead us there are blinding<br>
		There are many things that I would like to say to you<br>
		But I don't know how<br>
		<br>
		Because maybe<br>
		You're gonna be the one that saves me<br>
		And after all<br>
		You're my wonderwall<br>
		<br>
		Today was gonna be the day<br>
		But they'll never throw it back to you<br>
		By now you should've somehow<br>
		Realized what you're not to do<br>
		I don't believe that anybody<br>
		Feels the way I do about you now<br>
		<br>
		And all the roads that lead you there were winding<br>
		And all the lights that light the way are blinding<br>
		There are many things that I would like to say to you<br>
		But I don't know how<br>
		<br>
		I said maybe<br>
		You're gonna be the one that saves me<br>
		And after all<br>
		You're my wonderwall<br>
		<br>
		I said maybe (I said maybe)<br>
		You're gonna be the one that saves me<br>
		You're gonna be the one that saves me<br>
		You're gonna be the one that saves me
